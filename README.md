# Distilling the Knowledge of Specialist DNNs in Acoustic Scene Classification
This repository contains script and DNN models that was used for the DCASE2019 challenge task1-a.
Overall description of the system is in the [Workshop paper] (currently under review) and implementation details are further dealt in the [Technical report].
(for now, the Workshop paper link is connected to our previous work on Knowledge distillation in acoustic scene classification)
